Variations in scores across regions were observed for each measure ranging from 6.4-percentage points for engagement in treatment for people with dependence of alcohol or other drugs to 47.2-percentage points for appropriate testing for pharyngitis among children.{CONCLUSIONS}:Quality scores in California vary greatly across geographic regions. Statewide averages may misrepresent the quality of care that consumers are likely to receive within a geographic area making difficult assessments about the value of the health care.},

For both Medicaid and privately insured persons, compared with those who remained insured, persons losing coverage over a 2-year period were more likely to lack a usual source of care, encounter difficulty in obtaining medical care, be very dissatisfied with ability to obtain needed care, and report no physician visits in the previous 12 months. Uninsured people who gained coverage showed improvement across all indicators of access, in contrast to those who remained without insurance. The effects of changes in coverage on health were in the same direction as those for access, but did not reach statistical significance.

Assessing the law\&apos;s effects has major policy implications.{OBJECTIVES}:To estimate national changes in self-reported coverage, access to care, and health during the {ACA}\&apos;s first 2 open enrollment periods and to assess differences between low-income adults in states that expanded Medicaid and in states that did not expand Medicaid.{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}:Analysis of the 2012-2015 Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily national telephone survey. Using multivariable regression to adjust for pre-{ACA} trends and sociodemographics, we examined changes in outcomes for the nonelderly {US} adult population aged 18 through 64 years (n = 507,055) since the first open enrollment period began in October 2013. Linear regressions were used to model each outcome as a function of a linear monthly time trend and quarterly indicators. Then, pre-{ACA} (January 2012-September 2013) and post-{ACA} (January 2014-March 2015) changes for adults with incomes below 138\% of the poverty level in Medicaid expansion states (n = 48,905 among 28 states and Washington, {DC}) vs nonexpansion states (n = 37,283 among 22 states) were compared using a differences-in-differences approach.{EXPOSURES}:Beginning of the {ACA}\&apos;s first open enrollment period (October 2013).{MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}:Self-reported rates of being uninsured, lacking a personal physician, lacking easy access to medicine, inability to afford needed care, overall health status, and health-related activity limitations.{RESULTS}:Among the 507,055 adults in this survey, pre-{ACA} trends were significantly worsening for all outcomes. Compared with the pre-{ACA} trends, by the first quarter of 2015, the adjusted proportions who were uninsured decreased by 7.9 percentage points (95\% {CI}, -9.1 to -6.7); who lacked a personal physician, -3.5 percentage points (95\% {CI}, -4.8 to -2.2); who lacked easy access to medicine, -2.4 percentage points (95\% {CI}, -3.3 to -1.5); who were unable to afford care, -5.5 percentage points (95\% {CI}, -6.7 to -4.2); who reported fair/poor health, -3.4 percentage points (95\% {CI}, -4.6 to -2.2); and the percentage of days with activities limited by health, -1.7 percentage points (95\% {CI}, -2.4 to -0.9). Coverage changes were largest among minorities; for example, the decrease in the uninsured rate was larger among Latino adults (-11.9 percentage points [95\% {CI}, -15.3 to -8.5]) than white adults (-6.1 percentage points [95\% {CI}, -7.3 to -4.8]).

The literature\&apos;s broad range of conditions, populations, and methods makes it difficult to derive a precise quantitative estimate of the effect of having health insurance on the uninsured\&apos;s health. Some mortality studies imply that a 4\% to 5\% reduction in the uninsured\&apos;s mortality is a lower bound; other studies suggest that the reductions could be as high as 20\% to 25\%. Although all of the studies reviewed suffer from methodological flaws of varying degrees, there is substantial qualitative consistency across studies of different medical conditions conducted at different times and using different data sets and statistical methods. Corroborating process studies find that the uninsured receive fewer preventive and diagnostic services, tend to be more severely ill when diagnosed, and receive less therapeutic care. Other literature suggests that improving health status from fair or poor to very good or excellent would increase both work effort and annual earnings by approximately 15\% to 20\%.},

	abstract = {Back pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking care, and physical therapy ({PT}) can be an effective treatment option. However, {PT} coverage for back pain varies widely among private health plans, usually requiring high cost sharing, thereby potentially leading to member dissatisfaction and worse outcomes. In this study, a quasi-experimental design was used to estimate the impact of a new value-based insurance design for back pain-related {PT} on selected Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey items. Under this design, eligible members receive a bundle of 5 {PT} sessions for a 1-time co-payment; if deemed necessary, the bundle is renewable for 1 additional co-payment. The results indicate that the proportion of members reporting the highest satisfaction rating was higher by about 6 to 10 percentage points among those who received the {PT} bundle. The data also indicate that those {PT} bundle members who reported the highest satisfaction rating had improvements in their functional status scores that were roughly 3 to 4 times higher than those who reported a lower satisfaction rating. These findings suggest that providing a value-based insurance design for back pain-related {PT} can potentially improve health plan members\&apos; care experiences and their overall satisfaction. Further study is needed to determine its impact on back pain-related medical care utilization and cost of care.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: To compare healthcare quality, utilization, and patient satisfaction between provider-led health plans ({PLHPs}) and non-{PLHPs}.
{STUDY} {DESIGN}: Observational study of 2016 Medicare Advantage ({MA}) plans.
{METHODS}: We included 3 quality outcomes ({MA} Star Rating System, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set [{HEDIS}] effectiveness aggregate score, and {HEDIS} access aggregate score), 4 utilization outcomes ({HEDIS} average procedure rates, discharge rates, inpatient days, and readmission probability), and 1 patient satisfaction outcome (National Committee for Quality Assurance consumer satisfaction rating). We performed regression analysis to compare the 8 selected outcomes between {PLHPs} and non-{PLHPs}, controlling for key covariates, including region, profit status, patient risk, and patient-related and provider-related demographics.
{RESULTS}: Our sample included 64 contracts offered by 31 {PLHPs} (representing 3,197,284 enrollees) and 311 contracts offered by 55 non-{PLHPs} (representing 13,881,210 enrollees). Compared with non-{PLHPs}, in our primary multivariable model, {PLHPs} were associated with higher star ratings (β = 0.41; 95\% {CI}, 0.15-0.67), effectiveness scores (β = 3.11; 95\% {CI}, 1.43-4.80), and patient satisfaction (β = 0.57; 95\% {CI}, 0.30-0.84), and lower procedure rates (β = -0.47; 95\% {CI}, -0.79 to -0.16). There were no significant differences in access, discharges, inpatient days, and readmission probability. The association between {PLHPs} and outcomes differed by plan size, nonprofit status, and region.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Receipt of care within a {PLHP} was associated with improved quality, effectiveness, and patient satisfaction, as well as lower procedure rates. As providers bear increasing financial risk under alternative payment models, there is momentum to integrate healthcare provision and payment through {PLHPs}. Our results demonstrate the potential of such organizations to deliver high-quality care, although opportunities remain to optimize utilization.},

	abstract = {Medicare Advantage ({MA}) plans and the Veterans Affairs ({VA}) health care system assess quality of care using standardized Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set ({HEDIS}) performance measures. Little is known, however, about the relative accuracy of quality indicators for persons receiving care in more than one health care system. Among Veterans dually enrolled in an {MA} plan, we examined the agreement between {MA} and {VA} {HEDIS} assessments. Our study tested the hypothesis that private health plans underreport quality of care relative to a fully integrated delivery system utilizing a comprehensive electronic health record. Despite assessing the same individuals using identical measure specifications, reported {VA} performance was significantly better than reported {MA} performance for all 12 {HEDIS} measures. The {VA}'s performance advantage ranged from 9.8\% (glycosylated hemoglobin [{HbA}1c] {\textless} 7.0\% in diabetes) to 54.7\% (blood pressure {\textless} 140/90 mm Hg in diabetes). The overall agreement between {VA} and {MA} {HEDIS} assessments ranged from 38.5\% to 62.6\%. Performance rates derived from {VA} and {MA} aggregate data were 1.6\% to 14.3\% higher than those reported by {VA} alone. This analysis suggests that neither {MA} plans nor the {VA} fully capture quality of care information for dually enrolled persons. However, the {VA}'s system-wide electronic health record may allow for more complete capture of quality information across multiple providers and settings.},

Recently, the elimination of disparities in health care has become the focus of a national initiative. Yet, there is little effort to monitor and address disparities in health care through organizational quality improvement. After reviewing literature on disparities in health care, we discuss the limitations in existing quality assessment for identifying and addressing these disparities. We propose 5 principles to address these disparities through modifications in quality performance measures: disparities represent a significant quality problem; current data collection efforts are inadequate to identify and address disparities; clinical performance measures should be stratified by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position for public reporting; population-wide monitoring should incorporate adjustment for race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position; and strategies to adjust payment for race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position should be considered to reflect the known effects of both on morbidity.},

{METHODS}: We conducted a telephone survey in 2013 of 2765 low-income {US} citizens, aged 19 to 64 years, in Arkansas, Kentucky, and Texas. We compared 11 measures of access and quality of care for respondents with Medicaid, private insurance, Medicare, and no insurance with adjustment for sociodemographics and health status.
{RESULTS}: Low-income adults with Medicaid, private insurance, and Medicare reported significantly better health care access and quality than uninsured individuals. Medicaid beneficiaries reported greater difficulty accessing specialists but less risk of high out-of-pocket spending than those with private insurance. For other outcomes, Medicaid and private coverage performed similarly.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Low-income adults with insurance report significantly greater access and quality of care than uninsured adults, regardless of whether they have private or public insurance. Access to specialty care in Medicaid may require policy attention.

{OBJECTIVES}: To evaluate whether currently reported state-wide health plan quality scores accurately represent quality within pricing regions established for the Health Insurance Marketplace.
{RESEARCH} {DESIGN}: Observational, historical cohort study using health plan administrative and pharmacy data.
{SUBJECTS}: A total of 5.2 million members enrolled in the preferred provider organization health plans of 1 large commercial California insurer in 2012.
{MEASURES}: State-wide and pricing region performance on each of the 17 Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set ({HEDIS}) measures.
{RESULTS}: Across the 17 measures assessed in each of the 19 pricing regions, scores were statistically different (P{\textless}0.05) than the overall plan rate for 176 (54\%). Variations in scores across regions were observed for each measure ranging from 6.4-percentage points for engagement in treatment for people with dependence of alcohol or other drugs to 47.2-percentage points for appropriate testing for pharyngitis among children.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Quality scores in California vary greatly across geographic regions. Statewide averages may misrepresent the quality of care that consumers are likely to receive within a geographic area making difficult assessments about the value of the health care.},

Examining differences between individuals covered by different types of insurance is essential if healthcare executives are to develop new strategies in response to the emerging health insurance market. In this study, we used multigroup path analysis models to examine the moderating effects of health insurance on direct and indirect associations with general health status, satisfaction with received care, financial burden, and perceived value of the healthcare system. Data were obtained from the 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and analyzed according to the types of insurance: private, public, and military. With the satisfactory fit of the model (χ = 2,532.644, df = 96, p {\textless} .001; normed fit index = 0.943; incremental fit index = 0.945; comparative fit index = 0.957; root mean squared error of approximation = 0.044), higher healthcare quality was positively associated with better health status, greater satisfaction, and greater perceived value of the healthcare system in the three insurance groups. In addition, although all direct paths between health service quality and financial burden were not statistically significant, indirect effects were significant in all models through health status. Being married and earning higher incomes were also found to be strong predictors of better health status and health service quality. Efforts to improve the quality of health services are needed, which could contribute to a reduction in health disparities among insurance beneficiaries and result in less healthcare spending.},

We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to evaluate the evidence of the effects of {VBID} policies on medication adherence and medical expenditures. We identified thirteen studies assessing the effects of {VBID} programs and found that the programs were consistently associated with improved adherence (average change of 3.0 percent over one year), as well as with lower out-of-pocket spending for drugs. In the studies we reviewed, providing more generous coverage did not lead to significant changes in overall medical spending for patients and insurers.
